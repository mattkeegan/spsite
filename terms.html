Some features of Personal accounts may be limited based on how you wish to use the Service, how much you need to send and what we know about you.

								</li>
 								<li>
 									<b>Identity Authentication</b>
                 </br></br>
                You hereby authorize Company, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate your identity and/or authenticate your identity and account information and, for business accounts, your company or employer. This may include asking you for further information and/or documentation about your account usage or identity, or requiring you to take steps to confirm ownership of your email address, wireless/cellular telephone number or financial instruments, and verifying your information against third party databases or through other sources. This process is for internal verification purposes.
 								</li>
							<li>
								<b>Transaction History</b>
               </br></br>
              You may view your transaction history by logging into your SplitPal App. You agree to review your transaction history through your online account instead of receiving periodic statements by mail.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Sending Money</b> - Limits
               </br></br>
              We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can send or receive through the SplitPal App Service. Please see our Support Page http://splitpal.helpshift.com here for more details on limits. If we have authenticated your identity, we may increase your sending and/or receiving limits. These limits may change from time to time in Company’s sole discretion. You may not send money to your own account.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Sending Money</b> - Funding Sources
               </br></br>
              When you make a payment on SplitPal App, we first see if your SplitPal App balance can cover the transaction (i.e. if you have credits from promotions or other activities). You can also fund payments with a bank account, debit card or credit card, designating one of these to be your primary funding source.
</br></br>
We always use your SplitPal App balance first if the balance is sufficient to cover your payment. If there is not enough money available in your SplitPal App balance to cover the transaction, we use your designated primary funding source to make the payment in its entirety.
							</li>
              <li>
              <b>Sending Money</b> - Funding Limitations
              </br></br>
               In order to manage risk, Company may limit the funding sources available for your use to fund any particular transaction. For example, we may limit your funding sources for a particular transaction to debit cards or your checking account. Please note that the various funding sources have different dispute resolution means should your transaction turn out to be unsatisfactory.
              </li>
              <li>
              <b>Sending Money</b> - Bank Transfers
              </br></br>
               When your savings or checking account is used as your funding source (not current functional), you are requesting that we initiate on your behalf an electronic transfer from your bank account. For these transactions, Company will make electronic transfers from your bank account in the amount you specify. You agree that such requests constitute your authorization to Company to make the transfer, and once you have provided your authorization for the transfer, you will not be able to cancel the electronic transfer and Company may resubmit any debit you authorized that is returned for insufficient or uncollected funds, except as otherwise provided or restricted by applicable law.
              </li>
              <li>
              <b>Sending Money</b> - Refused &amp; Refunded Transactions
              </br></br>
               When you send money, the recipient is not required to accept it. You agree that you will not hold Company liable for any damages resulting from a recipient's decision not to accept a payment or from them crediting it to an incorrect account.
</br></br>
               If a recipient of funds is not a SplitPal App user and does not register for SplitPal App, Company will return your funds in 30 days. If the recipient does not collect the funds or register, set up an email address or mobile number and accept the transfer within 30 days, the transaction will be cancelled. During this period, a hold will be placed on your account for the amount of the transfer and the applicable fee, if any. Once the recipient has successfully registered as a SplitPal App user, transfers will automatically be debited from your account and credited in the recipient's account. 
</br></br>
               We will return any unclaimed, refunded or denied payment within 30 days of the date you initiate payment. If a payment is unclaimed, denied or refunded for any reason, we will return the money to your balance or to the original funding source.
              </li>
              <li>
              <b>Sending Money</b> - Card Processing
              </br></br>
               Company will process your credit or debit card-funded transactions through either the debit card's ATM debit network or the Visa/MasterCard network through our third party provider Stripe (or such other provider that Company may elect at its discretion).
              </li>
              <li>
              <b>Sending Money</b> - Credit Card Information
              </br></br>
               If your credit card account number changes or your credit card expiration date changes, we may acquire that information from our financial services partner and update your account.
              </li>
              <li>
              <b>Sending Money</b> - Fees for Sending Money
              </br></br>
               You may use the SplitPal App without charge to send money when transactions are funded by a bank account. Please see http://splitpal.helpshift.com for more information on fees. These fees may change from time to time in Company's sole discretion. You may be subject to third party fees, such as insufficient fund fees, reversal, or other fees that a bank may charge if your payment is rejected.
              </li>
              <li>
              <b>Payment Investigation</b>
              </br></br>
               Payment investigation is a process by which Company reviews certain potentially high-risk transactions. If a payment is subject to payment investigation, Company will place a hold on the payment and may provide notice to the recipient. Company will conduct a review and either clear or cancel the payment. If the payment is cleared, Company will provide notice to the recipient. Otherwise, Company will cancel the payment and the funds will be returned. Company will provide notice to you by email and/or in the account history tab of your SplitPal App account if the payment is canceled.
              </li>
              <li>
              <b>Risk of Reversals, Chargebacks &amp; Claims</b>
              </br></br>
               When you receive a payment, you are liable to Company for the full amount of the payment plus any fees if the payment is later invalidated for any reason. This means that, in addition to any other liability, you will be responsible for the amount of the payment, plus applicable fees if you lose a claim or a chargeback, or if there is a reversal of the payment. If a sender of a payment later disputes the payment or files a claim for a chargeback, the debit or credit card issuer or the originating bank, not Company, will determine whether the dispute is valid and to whom payment is due. You agree to allow Company to recover any amounts due to Company by debiting your balance. If there are insufficient funds in your balance to cover your liability, you agree to reimburse Company through other means. If Company is unable to recover the funds from your primary funding source, Company may attempt to contact you, Company may recover the funds from your alternate funding sources, or may take other legal actions to collect the amount due, to the extent allowed by applicable law.
              </li>
              <li>
              <b>Monies &amp; Account Balances</b> - General
              </br></br>
               Company is not a bank or other chartered depository institution. Funds charged or held by Company or its service providers (including any bank service providers) in connection with the processing of transactions are not deposit obligations and are not insured for the benefit of the user. Funds held are an ancillary function of enabling money transmission and not for other benefit.
              </li>
              <li>
              <b>Monies &amp; Account Balances</b> - Assignment of Interest to Company
              </br></br>
               You agree that you will not receive interest or other earnings on the funds that Company handles and places in pooled accounts for transfer. In consideration for your use of the service, you irrevocably transfer and assign to Company any ownership right that you may have in any interest that may accrue on funds held in pooled accounts. This assignment applies only to interest earned on your funds, and nothing in this Agreement grants Company any ownership right to the principal of the funds you maintain with Company.
              </li>
              <li>
              <b>Monies &amp; Account Balances</b> - Negative Balances
              </br></br>
               If the balance in your account is negative for any reason, Company may set off the negative balance by deducting amounts you owe Company from money you receive into your account, or money you attempt to withdraw or send from your account. You agree to allow Company to recover any amounts due to Company by debiting your balance. If there are insufficient funds in your balance to cover your liability, you agree to reimburse Company through other means. If Company is unable to recover the funds from your primary funding source, Company may attempt to contact you, Company may recover the funds from your alternate funding sources, or may take other legal actions to collect the amount due, to the extent allowed by applicable law.
              </li>
              <li>
              <b>Monies &amp; Account Balances</b> - Setoff of Past Due Amounts
              </br></br>
               If you have a negative balance or other past due amount to Company, Company may make attempts on your funding source to cover the amounts. If Company is unable to recover the funds from your primary funding source, Company may attempt to contact you, Company may recover the funds from your alternate funding sources, or may take other legal actions to collect any amounts that are more than 14 days past due, to the extent allowed by applicable law.
              </li>
              <li>
              <b>Monies &amp; Account Balances</b> - Security Interest
              </br></br>
               To secure your performance of this Agreement, you hereby grant to Company a lien on and security interest in your account and agree to execute any further documentation to perfect these Company rights.
              </li>
              <li>
              <b>Monies &amp; Account Balances</b> - Item Holds
              </br></br>
               Company, in its sole discretion, may place a hold on a payment you receive for a transaction when Company believes there may be a high level of risk associated with the transaction. If Company places a hold on your payment, it will show as "pending" in your SplitPal App account.
              </li>
              <li>
              <b>Account Holds &amp; Reserves</b> 
              </br></br>
               For high volume accounts, including business accounts, Company may, in its sole discretion, place a reserve on funds being transferred to you when it believes there may be a high level of risk associated with your account. If your account is subject to a reserve, Company will provide you with notice specifying the terms of the reserve. The terms may require that a certain percentage of the amounts received into your account are held for a certain period of time, or that a certain amount of money is held in reserve, or anything else that Company determines is necessary to protect against the risk associated with your account. Company may change the terms of the reserve at any time by providing you with notice of the new terms.
              </li>
              <li>
              <b>Termination</b> 
              </br></br>
               Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, we have the right to prohibit your access to the SplitPal App, including without limitation by deactivating your username and password, and to refuse future access to the SplitPal App by you or if a business entity, its parent, affiliates or subsidiaries or its or their successors.

                     Neither Company, Third Parties nor any of their respective affiliates, vendors, agents or suppliers will be liable for, and you agree not to seek against any of the foregoing, any damages of any kind arising from the use of the services, including, but not limited to, indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary, consequential damages or damages resulting from the use of service, loss of use of the service, lost data, lost profits, or business interruption arising out of or in any way connected with the use of the services, any delays in the services, or the inability to use the services, or any portion thereof, whether based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, even if all or any of us have been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if any remedy fails of its essential purpose.
  </br></br>
                     Company does not have any control over any products or services that are paid for with our services and Company cannot ensure that any party you are dealing with will actually complete the transaction or is authorized to do so.
  </br></br>
                     Company will make reasonable efforts to ensure that requests for electronic debits and credits involving bank accounts, credit cards, and check issuances are processed in a timely manner but Company makes no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing because Company is dependent upon many factors outside of our control, such as delays in the banking system or the Australian or international mail service.
  </br></br>
                     SOME STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE AND JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.

                    <b>Limitations on Liability</b> 
                    </br></br>
                     Except as otherwise EXPRESSLY provided in this agreement, and to the extent permissible under applicable law, Company's cumulative liability to you for any claims or damages arising out of or related to your use of SplitPal App or any other SplitPal service shall not exceed the greater of the fee you paid to Company for the use of the service or $1.00 AUD.
</br></br>
                     These limitations on liability apply to: anything related to a service or any application or content made available through any such service; and claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law. These limitations on liability also apply even if: repair, replacement or a refund for the service does not fully compensate you for any losses; or Company or a Covered Third Party knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.
</br></br>
                     These limitations on liability will apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, even if any remedy fails of its essential purpose.
</br></br>
                     Some states or other jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of liability so the foregoing limitations may not apply to you. You may also have other rights that vary from state to state and jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
